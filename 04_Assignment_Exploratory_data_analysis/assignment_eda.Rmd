Pass / Fail assignment

### Find a dataset and create an Exploratory Data Analysis. 
You can use data from anywhere. For example, you may use [Google dataset search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch), [Kaggle datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), a dataset from an `R` package, or something you collected yourself.

### Requirements
- explain the dataset in 1 or 2 paragraphs
- use `tidyverse`
- clean, legible `R` code (preferably following something close to the google style guide)
- table(s) with relevant summary statistics
- descriptive plots
- explain what you did and why (_maximum_ 3 paragraphs total) if applicable, note findings such as outliers or group differences

### Format: stand-alone RStudio project folder
- Should have these components:
  - the dataset (csv, xlsx, sav, dat, json, or any other common format)
  - one .Rmd (R Markdown) file
  - a compiled .pdf or .html
  - we should be able to compile the .Rmd to the same .pdf or .html. That means no errors!

### Example of how the folder could look before hand-in
